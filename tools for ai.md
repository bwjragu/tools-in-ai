Many problems in AI can be solved theoretically by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:
Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule.
Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.
Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space.
